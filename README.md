# Dork 2
The 2D sequel to the text based combat game

In the late 70s and early 80s, Zork was a popular text-based adventure game. Dork was a first attempt at a text-based combat game. It lacked any kind of graphics and the mechanics needed work.

Now, Dork is back as a 2D game!

Dork 2 was created for [Maximum Monster Month](https://itch.io/jam/maximum-monster-month), a Game Jam hosted on [itch.io](https://itch.io).

Project available under GPLv3. The source code for the original Dork is currently proprietary because it's so bad it's not worth sharing. However, a lot of the original Dork's source code will be reused in Dork 2. In any case, if people are interested, the source code for the original game can be released as well.

Orx game engine available under Zlib license (see [the repository](https://github.com/orx/orx) for details).
